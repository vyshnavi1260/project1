		<img class="b" src="./a3.webp" onclick="imgK(this.src, 'The Grand Palace','The Grand Palace in Bangkok, Thailand is one of the most stunning pieces of architecture in all Southeast Asia. It is richly decorated with gold and mirrors, really making it stand out from many other buildings.The Grand Palace is a complex of buildings at the heart of Bangkok, Thailand. The palace has been the official residence of the Kings of Siam (and later Thailand) since 1782. The king, his court, and his royal government were based on the grounds of the palace until 1925. Many tourists would recommend visiting at dawn when there are fewer people so it can be appreciated much better without being too crowded.')">
		<img class="b" src="./b3.webp" onclick="imgK(this.src, 'Koh Phi Phi','The tiny but idyllic west coast island of Koh Phi Phi is seen by many as the ultimate island paradise. Even though the island has now fully recovered from the devastating 2009 tsunami, it has sadly suffered from rapid tourist growth (especially since the release of “The Beach” starring Leo Dicaprio). In spite of this, Koh Phi Phi still manages to retain a relaxed vibe which seems to keep both the backpackers and the vacationers happy. Highlights include climbing a steep viewpoint to watch the sunset and hiring a long tail boat to snorkel in the beautiful surrounding waters.')">
		<img class="b" src="./c3.webp" onclick="imgK(this.src, 'Railay','Railay and the surrounding coast of the Krabi province (located in the South of Thailand) is a tropical paradise characterised by towering limestone cliffs, turquoise water, and powder white sand. From this area, it’s also easy to take a trip to nearby Phang Nga to see the famous ‘James Bond Rock’. Railay is a beautiful secluded beach – accessible only by boat – which attracts a mixture of in-the-know backpackers, well-heeled tourists, and enthusiastic rock climbers. Surrounded by dense vegetation and mountains, the area is also perfect for trekking. There are many beautiful beaches in Thailand but Railay is unique because it’s completely cut off from the daily grind.')">
		<img class="b" src="./d3.webp" onclick="imgK(this.src, 'The East Coast Islands','Koh Samui and Koh Phangan are islands located on the east side of Thailand which are popular with both vacationers and backpackers.Both islands are easily among the most beautiful places to visit in Thailand and they’re known for their palm tree-lined white sand beaches, clear turquoise waters, and laid-back attitudes. Koh Samui is more developed and geared towards holiday-makers and Koh Phangan with its cool cafes and world-famous full moon parties has more of a bohemian feel. Nearby, the rugged island of Koh Tao and the idyllic Koh Nang Yuan (pictured above) are only an inexpensive boat ride away.')">
		<img class="b" src="./e3.webp" onclick="imgK(this.src, 'San Kamphaeng Hot Springs','San Kamphaeng is a district located 36km from the northern city Chiang Mai. The area is home to the popular and reasonably priced hot springs which are set in a tranquil, 40-acre landscaped park. They are famous for their restorative properties and people come from miles to cure aches and pains and to take a break from the chaos of Bangkok. The deep-source springs reach over 100 degrees centigrade and are naturally high in sulfur. Visit to bath in the mineral-rich waters, camp in the surrounding parkland or to boil some eggs in the hot steaming pools!')">
		<img class="b" src="./f3.webp" onclick="imgK(this.src, 'Chiang Mai','Many travelers often mention Chiang Mai as their favorite Thai city and once visited it’s easy to see why. It’s located high in the north mountainous region of Thailand which makes it a great base for mountain trekking (organized treks can be arranged very easily here with almost every other shop offering them). Although the treks from Chiang Mai are interesting, they are often a well-worn path and many in-the-know backpackers now head for nearby Pai instead. Pai is a chilled-out small town located near the Myanmar border which has become popular with travelers, artists, and musicians. Head there for less touristy treks and more ‘rustic’ visits to hill tribes.')">
		<img class="b" src="./g3.webp" onclick="imgK(this.src, 'The Floating Market','The Floating Market (made famous by the James Bond classic “The Man with the Golden Gun”) is located on the Damnoen Saduak Canal in the region of Bangkok. Although now a major tourist attraction, the market is a photogenic place where visitors can get an idea of what trading was like in Thailand before the modernization of the city. It’s also a lot of fun. Buying something here means hailing down a narrow long boat piled high with produce – quite an experience in itself! The region is also filled with lush vineyards, orchards and thriving local businesses which are great to view by canal boat on your journey there.')">
		<img class="b" src="./h3.webp" onclick="imgK(this.src, ' Bangkok','Bangkok is a restless and chaotic metropolis and an essential part of a trip to Thailand. Although not everyone’s cup of tea, the culture-shock-inducing capital has some incredible places of interest that you would be foolish to miss. <br><br>Highlights include the impossibly bejeweled Grand Palace, Wat Arun (one of the oldest and best-known landmarks in Bangkok) and Wat Po which is home to a giant reclining Buddha. <br><br>Fun-seekers head for the notorious backpacker’s haven the Khao San road, the bazaars, and alleyways of Chinatown and the infamous Patpong Night Market (located in the city’s red-light district).')">

Standing on the ground looking at up at the incredible architecture is one thing though, take a trip up to the lookout is something else entirely. The journey up is an adventure in itself, but once you get to the lookout, you’re standing at a height of 555m on the 148th floor, and the view is surreal. It is so high that your brain has difficulty with what it is seeing, and it takes a minute or two to get used to it. Laid out in front of you is the beautiful scenery of the city, with the vast expanse of clear glass giving a 360-degree view to enjoy, it is unlike anything else you have experienced.')">
